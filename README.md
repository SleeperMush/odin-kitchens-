# odin-kitchens
This is my first 'The Odin Project' project for the Foundations course. I am just over a week into part time studying (11/17/2024). After completion of all the initial courses, along with HTML Foundations, I am going to make an initial website outlining kitchen design options. 

Hopefully I can use this website design to funnel into a more advanced website for work.

At the conclusion of this project, I will be exhibit my basic HTML structural syntax skills through use of anchors, images, links, elements, and lists (among other things).

Eventually I will apply CSS and Java elements to continue developing this project.
